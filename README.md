# 30 Days of Endfield Industries
## A Practice Project of Android Mobile Appdev

In the journey to train my Kotlin ability, this project will serve as the playground to test my mobile app dev skill. You can check out Android Dev Training Course here: https://developer.android.com/courses

Per the course Pathway 3. Unit 3., the task is to create a simple scrollable item-list app themed around "What topic interests you and inspires you to create an app?". Initially, I have no specific topic to home in, so it was going to be 30 Days of Lorem Ipsum. However, since I've been playing Endfield on its day-1, might as well use that instead.

## App Layout
I want to be fancy a bit in my item-list, so I want to combine various type of "Cards" into one scrollable list element. The Card types:
1. The Simple Image Description: text left hand-side, image right hand-side.
2. The Collapsible: A big image and short text. Expands when tapped to reveal more images and or texts.
